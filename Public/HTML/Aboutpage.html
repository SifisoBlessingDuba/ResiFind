</p><br>



<p>
At Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), every year, countless first-year and returning students face a major struggle finding accommodation on time. For many, especially those coming from distant provinces, this lack of housing creates severe hardships. Without access to essential services like showers, kitchens, beds, and privacy, many students are forced to sleep in uncomfortable, unsafe conditions at the student centre. This crisis not only impacts their well-being but also jeopardizes their academic success as they try to balance starting classes with an unstable living situation.
</p><br>



<p>
What’s worse, the process of securing student housing at CPUT is slow and often disorganized. Students are placed into residences at random, making it hard to connect with peers in the same programs or form study groups. Those who arrive late and miss out on early residence allocations fall behind academically, adding to their stress and anxiety.
</p><br>



<p>
To add to this, many students face financial exclusion due to lack of financial aid. With tuition fees, residence costs, and everyday living expenses piling up, some students are unable to register, obtain necessary certifications, or continue their studies smoothly. The combination of slow housing placements, financial struggles, and a lack of support creates barriers to education for many students, putting their futures at risk.
</p><br>



<p>
OUR MISSION.


Our platform aims to bring awareness to these pressing issues, share students' stories, and advocate for more efficient, transparent, and compassionate processes at CPUT. We believe that no student should face homelessness, exclusion, or uncertainty while trying to pursue higher education. Through collaboration, resource-sharing, and community support, we are committed to helping students navigate these difficult times and work towards lasting solutions.
</p><br>



<p>
Join us in our effort to make sure that every student can focus on what truly matters their education without having to worry about where they will sleep at night.
