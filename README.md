ResiFind
ResiFind is a web-based application developed to improve and simplify the student residence application process at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT). Traditionally, the residence application system was manual and paper-based, which caused delays, confusion, and inefficiency for both students and administrative staff. ResiFind aims to solve these challenges by offering an online platform where students can easily apply for on-campus accommodation, track the status of their applications, and receive timely updates.

This project was undertaken as a group assignment by a team of students collaborating to design and build a practical solution that addresses a real-world issue faced by the university community. The collective efforts included backend development, frontend design, database management, and project coordination to ensure the delivery of a functional and user-friendly product.

The core features of ResiFind include a secure user registration and authentication system, which allows students to create accounts and securely access the platform. Once logged in, students can fill out and submit their residence applications digitally, eliminating the need for paper forms. The platform provides a dashboard where students can monitor the status of their applications in real time, fostering transparency and reducing anxiety during the application process. On the administrative side, an admin panel was developed to manage incoming applications, allocate residence slots, and communicate updates to students effectively. The user interface was designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility across various devices, including desktops and mobile phones.

Technically, ResiFind was built using Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and routing, while the frontend utilizes standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive user experience. The application data is stored in a MySQL database, which supports efficient data management for user profiles, applications, and administrative records. Authentication is managed through secure methods to protect user information and maintain privacy.

To get started with ResiFind, the source code can be cloned from the GitHub repository. After installing the required dependencies using npm, users need to configure environment variables to connect to their MySQL database instance and set authentication secrets. Running the application locally will launch a development server, enabling users to interact with the system in a test environment.

It is important to note that this project was developed as a group effort, and the success of ResiFind reflects the combined contributions of all team members. Roles were distributed among the group, with responsibilities such as backend programming, frontend interface design, database management, and project documentation assigned accordingly to leverage individual strengths and ensure comprehensive coverage of all project aspects.

Overall, ResiFind represents a practical and impactful solution tailored to meet the needs of CPUT students seeking on-campus housing. The project demonstrates effective teamwork, application of modern web development technologies, and a focus on user-centered design to create a seamless and efficient residence application experience.
